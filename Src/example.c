// This example does the same function as the "basic" example, but demonstrates how easy it is
// to use the Notecard libraries to construct JSON commands and also to extract responses.
//
// Using the Notecard library, you can also easily set up your Arduino environment to "watch"
// JSON request and response traffic going to/from the Notecard on your Arduino debug port.
//
// Note that by using the Notecard library, it is also quite easy to connect the Notecard to
// a Microcontroller's I2C ports (SDA and SCL) rather than using Serial, in case there is no
// unused serial port available to use for the Notecard.

// type of device has embedded the Notecard, and by extension which vendor or customer is in charge
// of "managing" it.  In order to set this value, you must first register with notehub.io and
// "claim" a unique product ID for your device.  It could be something as simple as as your email
// address in reverse, such as "com.gmail.smith.lisa.test-device" or "com.outlook.gates.bill.demo"
